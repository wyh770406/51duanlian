Description:
    Stubs out a scaffolded controller and its views. Pass the model name,
    either CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.
    The controller name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model
    name.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers/admin and template engine.

Example:
    `rails generate admin_scaffold_controller CreditCard number:string`

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller:      app/controllers/admin/credit_cards_controller.rb
        Views:           app/views/admin/credit_cards/index.html.erb [...]
